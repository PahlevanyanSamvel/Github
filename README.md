## Arcitecture

The app architecture includes MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Clean Architecture, Use Cases, and Repository Pattern, is designed to promote separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. Let's break down each component and how they fit together within the context of the app. 
In the given context, the app architecture would involve implementing the MVVM pattern for the presentation layer, adopting Clean Architecture principles to separate the app into layers (Domain, Data, and Presentation), utilizing Use Cases to encapsulate business logic and interactions, implementing repositories for data access and persistence, and incorporating Coordinators for managing navigation flows.

## Reason of the architecture

This architecture promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability by separating concerns and reducing dependencies between different components. It allows for easier collaboration among developers, as each component has well-defined responsibilities and can be developed independently.


## Missing features

# Reactive progroamming (Combine)

Overall, reactive programming in Swift provides a more concise, composable, and declarative approach to handling asynchronous operations, event-driven programming, and UI binding. It improves code readability, reusability, and testability, making it an attractive choice for developing reactive and responsive applications.

# Local storrage (Realm/CoreDate)

Both Realm and Core Data have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. Realm excels in simplicity, performance, and cross-platform support, while Core Data provides integration with the Apple ecosystem, flexibility in data modeling, and advanced querying capabilities. Your choice between the two depends on your project's requirements, preferences, and familiarity with the framework.

# Offline support

Her you can see how can work an offline-first approach in the following example.
By implementing the above system, we provide users with a seamless experience in managing their favorite items even when they are offline. The local Realm database allows for immediate access and modification of favorite items, while the synchronization process ensures that changes are reflected on the server when the network is available again. This offline-first approach prioritizes the local user experience while keeping the remote data in sync.
